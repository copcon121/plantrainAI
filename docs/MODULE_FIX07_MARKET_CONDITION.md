# Deprecated Module Doc — Market Condition

Market condition logic is folded into the unified v3 flow and is not a separate module anymore. Decisions rely solely on exporter fields and the single labeling rule set.

Refer to:
- `docs/01_LAYER1_EXPORTER.md`
- `docs/02_LAYER2_LABEL_RULES.md`
- `docs/03_LAYER3_TRAIN_LOOP.md`
- `docs/04_LAYER4_DEPLOY_INFER.md`
- `docs/05_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md`

Any future market-condition signals must be added as exporter fields and reflected across all v3 documents together.
