# Deprecated Module Doc — Liquidity Map

This document is retired. Liquidity context in v3 is reduced to canonical exporter fields (`sweep_prev_high`, `sweep_prev_low`) and is consumed directly by the unified labeling rules.

Canonical references:
- Exporter: `docs/01_LAYER1_EXPORTER.md`
- Label rules: `docs/02_LAYER2_LABEL_RULES.md`
- Train loop: `docs/03_LAYER3_TRAIN_LOOP.md`
- Deploy/Infer: `docs/04_LAYER4_DEPLOY_INFER.md`
- Architecture overview: `docs/05_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md`

No separate liquidity module remains; follow the single v3 flow.
