# Deprecated Module Doc — Volume Profile

Volume profile is not modeled as a separate module in v3. The only accepted schema is the Layer 1 exporter + Layer 2 labels + Layer 3/4 pipeline.

Canonical references:
- `docs/01_LAYER1_EXPORTER.md`
- `docs/02_LAYER2_LABEL_RULES.md`
- `docs/03_LAYER3_TRAIN_LOOP.md`
- `docs/04_LAYER4_DEPLOY_INFER.md`
- `docs/05_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md`

If volume-profile context is reintroduced, it must be added as exporter fields and reflected in all v3 docs simultaneously.
